# SqrFace-App
Nowadays, the camera on our smartphones can capture high-quality images with a high resolution. Having said that, we can run a variety of recognition procedures on these photos. Face detection is a sort of recognition that is quite prevalent in modern society. We utilize it daily for social networking, mobile security, and other purposes. Robust face recognition systems have recently become increasingly useful in a variety of domains, including terrorism and crime prevention, as well as diverse user identification in real and virtual environments for improved security. SqrSafe is a timely application for the current time. Many businesses have implemented a policy that states that if you don't have a vaccination card or a Safe QR code, you can't enter. Many individuals forget about these basic criteria, and it might be inconvenient to have to constantly haul out vaccination cards and QR codes from their backpacks. In this project, we proposed to develop a mobile-based face detection system that will display userâ€™s vaccination status, and Safe Qr Code retrieved from a database. This type of application has a wide range of uses, including assisting those suffering from mental conditions associated with memory loss.
